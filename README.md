Hello and welcome to my GitHub profile! 

I'm a self taught software developer with a passion for coding and problem-solving. I specialize in developing software applications and games using a variety of programming languages and technologies.

Projects
On my GitHub page, you'll find a collection of batch files that optimize the performance of PC games to improve their frame rate and reduce lag. These batch files are designed to be easy to use and can be customized to suit your individual needs.

It's important to note that any damage caused to your PC as a result of using these batch files is solely the responsibility of the user (you). While I've taken care to ensure that these batch files are safe and effective, I cannot guarantee that they will work for every user or every game.

Contributions
I'm also an active contributor to various open-source projects on GitHub. I believe in the power of open-source software and enjoy collaborating with others to improve and enhance existing projects. Some of the contributions I've made include bug fixes, new features, and documentation improvements.

Contact Me
If you'd like to get in touch with me, please feel free to send me a message on GitHub. I'm always open to new ideas and opportunities to collaborate with others in the software development community.
